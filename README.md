### Arduino Library for I2C Input Output Expander

The PCF8574 is a device that allows users to expand the number of digital input/output pins of a microcontroller via the I2C bus (Texas Instruments, 2016). The Bonezegei library provides functions for basic port manipulation, such as reading and writing to the pins (Batutay, 2023). The paper demonstrates the installation of the library on Arduino 2 IDE and shows examples of how to use the library functions in various scenarios.
